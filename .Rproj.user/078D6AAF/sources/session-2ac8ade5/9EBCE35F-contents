## Education in Emergencies Indicators
  
  

### Indicator 1


Indicator 1 is the sum of **boys** and **girls** reached with **completed** activities under the indicator *`r eie %>% filter(str_detect(indicator, "1")) %>% slice(1) %>% pull(indicator)`*. 

However, it should be noted that there are a substantial number of men and women reported under indicator 1. Unfortunately, these persons are not counted under the sector reached or the reached by indicator.

  
  

```{r}
eie %>% 
  filter(str_detect(indicator, "1") & activity_status == "Completed") %>% 
  filter(men > 0 | women > 0) %>% 
  group_by(county) %>% 
  summarise(men = sum(men, na.rm = TRUE), 
            women = sum(women, na.rm = TRUE)) %>% 
  janitor::adorn_totals("row") %>% 
  flextable() %>% 
  theme_zebra() %>% 
  set_caption("Adults reported under Indicator 1") %>% 
  set_table_properties(width = .9)
  
```

  
  


### Indicator 2

Indicator 2 is the sum of **men**, **women**, **boys** and **girls** reached with **completed** activities under *`r eie %>% filter(str_detect(indicator, "2")) %>% slice(1) %>% pull(indicator)`*.

  
  

### Indicator 3

Indicator 3 is the sum of **men**, **women**, **boys** and **girls** reached with **completed** activities under *`r eie %>% filter(str_detect(indicator, "3")) %>% slice(1) %>% pull(indicator)`*.

  
  

### Indicator 4

Indicator 3 is the sum of **men**, **women**, **boys** and **girls** reached with **completed** activities under *`r eie %>% filter(str_detect(indicator, "4")) %>% slice(1) %>% pull(indicator)`*.

  
  

### Indicator 5

Indicator 5 is the sum of **men** and **women** reached with **completed** activities under *`r eie %>% filter(str_detect(indicator, "5")) %>% slice(1) %>% pull(indicator)`*. 

However, it should be noted that there are a number of girls and boys reported under indicator 5. Unfortunately, these persons are not counted under the sector reached or the reached by indicator.

  
  

```{r}
eie %>% 
  filter(str_detect(indicator, "5") & activity_status == "Completed") %>% 
  filter(boys > 0 | girls > 0) %>% 
  group_by(county) %>% 
  summarise(boys = sum(boys, na.rm = TRUE), 
            girls = sum(girls, na.rm = TRUE)) %>% 
  janitor::adorn_totals("row") %>% 
  flextable() %>% 
  theme_zebra() %>% 
  set_caption("Children reported under Indicator 5") %>% 
  set_table_properties(width = .9)
  
```


  
  
### Indicator 6


Indicator 6 is the sum of **boys** and **girls** reached with **completed** activities under *`r eie %>% filter(str_detect(indicator, "6")) %>% slice(1) %>% pull(indicator)`*. 

There are comparatively few men and women reported under indicator 6. Nevertheless, only children reached count towards this indicator and the sector reached. 



 

```{r}
eie %>% 
  filter(str_detect(indicator, "6") & activity_status == "Completed") %>% 
  filter(men > 0 | women > 0) %>% 
  group_by(county) %>% 
  summarise(men = sum(men, na.rm = TRUE), 
            women = sum(women, na.rm = TRUE)) %>% 
  janitor::adorn_totals("row") %>% 
  flextable() %>% 
  theme_zebra() %>% 
  set_caption("Adults reported under Indicator 6") %>% 
  set_table_properties(width = .9)
  
```

# Sector Reached

The sector reached is the sum of persons reached by EiE indicators **1**, **2**, **5** and **6**: 

<br>

* `r eie %>% filter(str_detect(indicator, "1")) %>% slice(1) %>% pull(indicator)`

* `r eie %>% filter(str_detect(indicator, "2")) %>% slice(1) %>% pull(indicator)`

* `r eie %>% filter(str_detect(indicator, "5")) %>% slice(1) %>% pull(indicator)`

* `r eie %>% filter(str_detect(indicator, "6")) %>% slice(1) %>% pull(indicator)`

<br>

All earlier conditions still apply i.e. men and women reported under indicator 1 are not counted towards the indicator reached or the sector reached. Only **completed** activities are included. 

The rationale for choosing to sum these four indicators for the sector reached is that the likelihood of overlap in beneficiaries between these activities is minimal. 

However, for future reference, a more robust form of calculating sector reached would be by summing the highest number of boys, girls, men and women reached across all schools and other institutions with EiE activities. Even more robust would be a beneficiary database, which would go hand in hand with tracking enrolment.
